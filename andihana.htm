  <h2 style = "text-align: center; color: white"> ABOUT US </h2>
  <p  style= "text-align: center"> Like any good story, the history of Andihana
  begins with the descendent of a samurai warrior and a small Tokyo coffee shop.
  Just after the war, Yunosuke Aoki (a samurai descendent and popular entertainer) 
  decided to start a coffee shop with his wife, Katsu. Wanting to offer something
  different than other coffee shops in the area, Yunosuke Aoki rode his bike over 
  20 miles to purchase real sugar to serve in his shop. This flair for doing something
  different caught the eye of his son, Hiroaki. As did the shop’s name: Andihana.
  After college, Hiroaki (or Rocky, as he would become known) moved to the U.S. 
  to pursue his dream of opening his own restaurant. One that combined his father’s
  flair for doing something different with food that was truly memorable. But with
  little money to his name, Rocky’s path was not an easy one. He started by selling
  ice cream on the streets of Harlem while studying restaurant management at night.
  The ice cream business turned out to be very profitable, thanks in part to the 
  colorful Japanese cocktail umbrellas he added to the treats, and he managed to 
  save up $10,000 for his first Andihana restaurant. With his seed money in place,
  Rocky took out a loan and used it to start America’s first Japanese teppanyaki
  restaurant on West 56th street. Named after his parents’ Tokyo coffee shop, Andihana
  opened in 1964, featuring an authentic Japanese farmhouse interior and food prepared
  on steel teppanyaki grills right in front of customers. His highly trained teppanyaki
  chefs delighted customers with intricate knife work and theatrics. Not to mention 
  delicious food. But it wasn’t until legendary food critic Clementine Paddleford 
  gave Andihana a rave review that the restaurant really took off, paying for itself
  in just six months. Soon after, Rocky opened a second Andihana in New York and
  a third Andihana restaurant in Chicago. By 1972, there were six Andihana locations 
  in the United States, with more opening every day. Sadly, Rocky Aoki died in 2008
  at the age of 69. But, his legacy lives on with more than 70 Andihana restaurants
  in the United States, Caribbean, and Central and South America, and more than 
  100 million meals served. </p>
